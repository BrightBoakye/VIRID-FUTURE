# Virid-Punk
Virid Punk is an innovative tool designed to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions based on satellite images. The tool uses a combination of machine learning algorithms, image processing, and remote sensing techniques to classify crops, determine land cover, and predict yields. By analyzing the satellite images, Virid Punk can identify the types of crops present in a particular field, monitor their growth and health, and predict their yield based on a range of factors such as weather conditions, soil moisture, and temperature. This information can help farmers optimize their planting and harvesting schedules, manage their resources more efficiently, and increase their overall productivity. Virid Punk provides a user-friendly interface that allows farmers to easily access the data and insights they need to make informed decisions. Overall, Virid Punk is a valuable tool that can significantly improve the efficiency and productivity of agriculture.
The project is still in development and addition of features, you can try out our land classification model for now.
